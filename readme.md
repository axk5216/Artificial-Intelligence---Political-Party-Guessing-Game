#Political Party Guessing Game - Artificial Intelligence

This java-based application uses Bayes Theorem to determine a political party for a user based on three questions.  The application comprehensively analyzes responses for each political party within the data stores and accurately guesses the political party based on question weights.  For example, the response A in each question corresponds with Democrat, and if the answer is A for each question then the corresponding weights are multiplied against the probability of answer A being democratic.  This was a college project and it received a perfect score.  Can be applied to other research-based questions as well.
